Looks like you chanced upon my page. Welcome! I'm a mathematician at heart, who's trying to make sense of the world one dataset at a time. Did a PhD in Mathematics, proved a few theorems relating to probability theory, worked for a while doing simulations of gene networks, and am now doing data science stuff.

The best place to look me up is linkedIn, but if you're really just looking for some light night time reading, my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kam2KcYAAAAJ) page is not a bad place.
