Looks like you chanced upon my page. Welcome! I'm a mathematician at heart, who's trying to make sense of the world one dataset at a time. Did a PhD in Mathematics, proved a few theorems relating to probability theory, worked for a while doing simulations of gene networks, and am now doing data science stuff.

### More Information

I like doing nothing at all for long periods of time. Chances are I am pretty average that way. So average, in fact, that this averageness is notable in and of itself. 

### Contact me

The best place to look me up is linkedIn, but if you're really just looking for some light night time reading, my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kam2KcYAAAAJ) page is not a bad place.
